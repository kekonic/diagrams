# @kekonic/diagrams-layout

## 1.0.0-rc.4

### Patch Changes

- 1d5519f: Add the official host-neutral `design-kekonic-diagrams` agent skill with grounded modeling,
  deterministic validation and rendering, progressively loaded editorial design, diagram-pattern,
  repair, and delivery guidance, and public installation documentation. Plan a clean replacement of
  the legacy example corpus after the agent capability and evaluation foundations are stable, and
  record the semantic, view, boundary, layout, provenance, and quality-analysis gaps revealed by the
  expert workflow as future product opportunities. Add KDiagram-specific semantic and measurable
  visual-review guidance plus an explicit architecture modeling and feature-use contract based on
  clean-room agent evaluation, and restore arrowheads on directed dependency edges discovered by that
  evaluation.
  Require concise plain-language subtitles and a bounded rendered layout bake-off so agents compare
  credible directions, region arrangements, and density choices instead of accepting the first valid
  composition.
  Add focused hexagonal-architecture guidance for ports, adapter placement, inward dependencies,
  repeated module stacks, single-poster limits, and progressive detail views based on a second
  clean-room evaluation.
  Make diagram-level region arrangement include ungrouped nodes as declaration-ordered track cells,
  so architecture views can stage actors, service regions, adapters, and external systems without
  inventing layout-only wrapper groups.
  Add the first-class `state` diagram surface with initial/final structural validation and UML-style
  initial/final rendering. Add post-layout FM220–FM224 quality diagnostics for extreme canvases,
  perimeter-spanning edges, crossings, reverse-flow pressure, and edge-label density. Expand the
  official skill and public design documentation with focused state-machine, responsibility-workflow,
  and event-driven composition guidance derived from clean-room evaluations.
  Fix formatting of styled edges with property blocks so agents can combine semantic styles and
  layout priority without producing invalid source.

## 1.0.0-rc.3

### Minor Changes

- e7a2d1f: Harden the final release candidate across delivery, tooling, and documentation.

  - Load only requested Iconify glyphs in browsers while preserving the complete installed collections for Node and CLI rendering.
  - Split the lightweight React live renderer from playground and Shiki entry points, and add copy/download playground actions.
  - Add strict CLI flag handling, stdin and JSON diagnostics, version output, browser bundle budgets, and representative SVG regression snapshots.
  - Scope snapshot theme tokens to inline SVGs, improve package metadata and compatibility declarations, and expand the product, quick-start, comparison, CLI, API, icon, and embedding documentation.

- d12b18d: Add first-class sequence diagrams: top-level `sequence { … }` DSL, SequenceIR compile path, dedicated `sequence-v1` time-axis layout (lifelines, activations, fragments, notes), SVG paint + theme tokens, return op `-->`, and auto message-walk animation. Includes Temporal order-workflow sequence twin in examples/gallery.

## 1.0.0-rc.2

### Minor Changes

- 27349fb: Add diagram animations: opt-in Automatic via empty named `animation` blocks (exclusive chapters vs parallel fan-out; `dim *` clears sticky highlights between chapters), authored cue scripts (including `parallel`), an SVG player on RenderController (`setSpeed`, `subscribe`, …), and Lit/React controls (picker, scrubber, 0.5×–2× speed). Diagrams stay static until an animation is declared.

## 1.0.0-rc.1

### Minor Changes

- 5032ae2: Polish the DSL before stable: EdgeKind sync/async/eventual/association, soft keywords, concrete spacing, trimmed presentation chrome, and Shiki/lexer parity.

### Patch Changes

- 2465ce7: Add Changesets, Conventional Commits, CI/release workflows, Dependabot, and contributing docs.
  Keep guide docs evergreen (versions live in CHANGELOG / package metadata).
  One product version across publishable packages and the private website app.
